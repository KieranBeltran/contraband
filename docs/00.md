Contraband
==========

Contraband is a description language for your datatypes and APIs,
currently targeting Java and Scala.

You describe the types and fields of your API,
and Contraband will:

- generate either Java classes, or a pseudo case classes in Scala.
- generate JSON bindings for the datatypes.

Contraband also enables you to evolve the API over time.

### Note

Contraband is NOT supported under the Lightbend subscription.
